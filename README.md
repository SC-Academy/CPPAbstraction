## C++ Program to Calculate the Area of a Circle and Rectangle

This C++ program defines an abstract class called Shape and two concrete classes called Circle and Rectangle. The Shape class has a pure virtual function called calculateArea() which must be implemented by all concrete classes that inherit from it. The Circle and Rectangle classes implement the calculateArea() function using the appropriate formula for calculating the area of a circle or rectangle, respectively.

To use the program, simply compile and run it. It will create a Circle object and a Rectangle object, then print the area of each object to the console.

### Output :
Circle Area: 78.5398 </br>
Rectangle Area: 24.0000</br> </br>

### Building the Program

To build the program, you can use any C++ compiler. For example, to build the program using the GCC compiler, you would run the following command: </br>
`g++ -o main main.cpp` </br>
This will create an executable file called `main`. You can then run the program by typing `./main`.
